Suppose You have 2 repositories:

    :::
    https://github.com/synckey/synckey.github.io.git
    https://git.coding.net/synckey/synckey.git

You want to push to them within one command.

    :::shell
    # if your project is cloned from this repository, 
    # you can simply ignore this first command
    git remote add origin https://git.coding.net/synckey/synckey.git
    git remote set-url --add https://git.coding.net/synckey/synckey.git


Then if you want to push to both of them, just rum `git push` as normal.

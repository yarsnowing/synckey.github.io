>Some people think that it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of humans. Others, however, think that it is wrong to exploit animals for human purposes. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

**Notice:** this is my practice writing  which may be the worst approach.I am glad to receive any kind of advises(grammar or misuse,etc).

It is undoubtedly the case that the number of animals used for human being's benefit  is increasingly large.Some people think
this is unethical and unfair to benefit from animals ,but others hold the opposite view. Personally, my opinion is that we should
use animals correctly and ethically.

Firstly,we are at the top of the food chain, it is completely  natural to kill animals for food.There are thousands of animal farms all over the world which provide chicken,beef and so on,
Without them,many people will encounter starving,because meat is main food that provide protein and nutrition for human beings.In order to live on, we have to raise and kill animals for food.

Meanwhile,animals play a significant role in scientific research.They have been used in many fields,ranging from medical tests to space exploring.For instance,
in medical industry, before a new drug is put into production,animal testing is a necessary to see if the drug is safe or have some unpredictable side effects.
We have to depend on animals in those areas,because we do not have alternatives,scientists can not do experiments on a human being instead of a rat.

However, other people argue that we do not have the right to take the animals' lives for our own benefits,lives should be
respected. What is more ,the benefits of researches can not justify the suffering caused. But,this is unrealistic .
We should focus on how to minimize the sufferings that animals experienced when used by people.

In sum,animal is an extremely important source of food for human beings which can contribute to the science as well.We can surely use
animals to live on,but we should use them scientifically and ethically.

**Notice:** this is my practice writing  which may be the worst approach.I am glad to receive any kind of advises(grammar or misuse,etc).

Recently,what kind of knowledge should a university provide its graduates with has been increasingly popular.Some of us
hold the view that universities should teach their students job-related skills.But others do not agree,they
think that universities should mainly focus on theoretical knowledge.Personally,I agree with the later view.

The basic knowledge,many of which have developed for hundred of years and have been refined by countless of experts,is 
significantly important to a university student.Without it, they can not form their systematic knowledge of their 
professions which will lead to serious results,for instance,they may be unable to do further or complex jobs.That is why 
many people think that the universities should put more attention on teaching basic knowledge.

What is more,companies concern about the ability of solving problems and the ability to learn fast more than job skills.
Many renowned companies,such as google and facebook,ask a lot of basic questions in their job interviews.They believe 
that,if you are able to learn the basic lessons well at school, you can soon become a skilled employee after professional
trainings.So, if a university teaches basic knowledge better,it can anticipate more competitive graduates.

As to the job-related skills, the technology used in industry is developing extraordinarily fast that the universities can 
not keep pace with it.It is hard for them to decide what is the best skill for their students.However,they should not totally
ignore the requirements of the job market,alternatively,they can invite some companies to their campus to introduce what 
kind of skill they want.

In summary,although the main goal of going to universities of many students is finding a ideal job after graduating,universities
should help their students to build a good knowledge system and help them to be quick learners and problem solvers instead of
just teaching them job-related skills.

>Many people use distance-learning programmes(study material post, TV, Internet, etc.) to study at home,
but some people think that it cannot bring the same benefits of attending college or university.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.

**Notice:** this is my practice writing  which may be the worst approach.I am glad to receive any kind of advises(grammar or misuse,etc).

Distance learning is a relatively recent phenomenon and if it is as  good as traditional classroom-based learning still
remains to be controversial.Many people believe that the online courses are better than those provided at school,but
others hold the totally opposite view.Personally,I think that we can benefit from both approaches,they can make up for
each other.

In terms of distance learning,it is convenient for adults,especially people who are busy with their works.Studying at
home enables them to receive further education, which is significantly important for us in a tech-driven society.Meanwhile,
the courses on the Internet or TV are usually well prepared and given by renowned experts,which helps to ensure the quality.

But school education is surely one of the most import sources of information and knowledge.They can provide structured courses
as well as better schedules.The teachers in the school can not only help us to learn,but also provide specific guidances
and life experience.And discussing with classmates from the school contributes to better understanding of what we are
learning.

So,we can make the most of both distance learning and classroom-based learning. If a student did not catch waht he had learned
on the class,he can download some courses from Internet to make up for it.An adult can also turn to classes for help
when he encounter some problems which he can not tackle all by himself.

So, while we are taking advantage of technology,we should not neglect the importance of traditional learning.We should
chose our learning methods according to our circumstances.

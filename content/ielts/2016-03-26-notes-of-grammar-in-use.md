###主要的时态

* present perfect(I have done)
* present perfect continuous(I have been doing),强调从过去到现在的一个过程.
* present perfect simple

* `anybody` 要用单数形式修饰:Is anybody listening to the radio or can I turn it off?
    * Is anybody sitting here?
* The train is never late,it always leaves on time.
* be always doing sth.
    一般情况下,用I always do sth.表示自己一直做什么事,be always doing sth.表示并不每次发生,但是发生的次数比正常的要多.
    * You're always watching television.You should do something more active.
    * I've lost my key again.I'm always losing things.
* This room `smells`.Let's open a window.
* It(this) is the first time somebody has done sth.

* How long have you (been)...

    * But we use `simple` with always: John has always lived in London.
    * We use `present perfect simple` in negative sentences:
        * I haven't seen Tom since Monday.
        * Jane hasn't phoned me for two weeks.
* Have you had had a holiday recently?
* 想问别人时间的时候可以说:
    1. Do you have the time?
    2. Have you got the time?
* have 和 have got 都可以用来表示有,但是在过去式中,用had(不用had got).
* used to
    1. "Something used to happen" = something happened regularly in the past but no longer happens.
        * I used to play tennis a lot but I don't play often now.
        * Diane used to travel a lot.These days she doesn't go away so often.
    2. We also use **used to ...** for somethins was true .
        * I've started drinking coffee recently.I never used to like it before.
        * Janet used to have very long hair when she was a child.
    3. used to 的疑问形式为did (you) use to ...
        * Did you use to eat a lot of sweets when you were a child?
* be used to doing sth.习惯于某事
   * I am used to living alone.
* I am doing sth.可以用于表示未来已经安排好的事情.
    * Alex is getting married next month.(不要用 will get)
* Present simple(I do) with a future meaning:we use the present simple when we talk about timetables,programmes etc.(for example,for public transport,cinemas etc):
    * The train `leaves` Plymouth at 11.30 and `arrives` in London at 14.45.
    * What time does the film begin?

如果一个人的计划订的像时间表,也可以用一般现在时:

* I start my new job on Monday.
* What time do you finish work tomorrow?

但是描述个人安排时,进行时更常见:

* What time are you meeting Ann tomorrow?

* be doing 和 be going to do表示未来的差别
    * We normally use I am doing(present continuous) when we say what we have arranged to do.
        * I'm leaving tomorrow.I've got my plane ticket.
    * 'I am going to do ' = I've decided to do it(but perhaps not arranged to do it);
        * 'The windows are dirty.' 'Yes, I know.I'am going to clean them later.'(=I've decided to clean them but I haven't arranged to clean them).
* was going to (do something)= I intended to do it but didn't do it.
* Do not use will to talk about what you have already decided or arranged to do.We often use will in those situations:
    1. Offering to do sth.
        * That bag looks very heavy.I will help with it.
    2. Agreeing to dong something.
        * A:You know that book I lent you.Can I have it back if you've finished with it? B:Of course.I'll give it to you this after noon.
    3. Promising to do sth.
        * I won't tell anyone what happend.I promise.
    4. Asking somebody to do sth.(Will you ...?)
        * Will you please be quiet?I'm trying to concentrate.
            
   
    

* 不规则动词们:
    * fall->fell->fallen
    * fly->flew->flown
    * begin->began->begun

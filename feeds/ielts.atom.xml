&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;anybody&lt;/code&gt; 要用单数形式修饰:Is anybody listening to the radio or can I turn it off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is anybody sitting here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The train is never late,it always leaves on time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be always doing sth.
    一般情况下,用I always do sth.表示自己一直做什么事,be always doing sth.表示并不每次发生,但是发生的次数比正常的要多.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're always watching television.You should do something more active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've lost my key again.I'm always losing things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This room &lt;code&gt;smells&lt;/code&gt;.Let's open a window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It(this) is the first time somebody has done sth.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's the first time he has driven a car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long have you (been)...&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long have they been married?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But we use &lt;code&gt;simple&lt;/code&gt; with always: John has always lived in London.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;present perfect simple&lt;/code&gt; in negative sentences:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven't seen Tom since Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jane hasn't phoned me for two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you had had a holiday recently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;想问别人时间的时候可以说:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have the time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you got the time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have 和 have got 都可以用来表示有,但是在过去式中,用had(不用had got).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used to&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Something used to happen" = something happened regularly in the past but no longer happens.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used to play tennis a lot but I don't play often now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diane used to travel a lot.These days she doesn't go away so often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also use &lt;strong&gt;used to ...&lt;/strong&gt; for somethins was true .&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've started drinking coffee recently.I never used to like it before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Janet used to have very long hair when she was a child.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used to 的疑问形式为did (you) use to ...&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you use to eat a lot of sweets when you were a child?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be used to doing sth.习惯于某事&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am used to living alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am doing sth.可以用于表示未来已经安排好的事情.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alex is getting married next month.(不要用 will get)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present simple(I do) with a future meaning:we use the present simple when we talk about timetables,programmes etc.(for example,for public transport,cinemas etc):&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The train &lt;code&gt;leaves&lt;/code&gt; Plymouth at 11.30 and &lt;code&gt;arrives&lt;/code&gt; in London at 14.45.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What time does the film begin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果一个人的计划订的像时间表,也可以用一般现在时:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I start my new job on Monday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What time do you finish work tomorrow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;但是描述个人安排时,进行时更常见:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What time are you meeting Ann tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be doing 和 be going to do表示未来的差别&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We normally use I am doing(present continuous) when we say what we have arranged to do.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm leaving tomorrow.I've got my plane ticket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'I am going to do ' = I've decided to do it(but perhaps not arranged to do it);&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'The windows are dirty.' 'Yes, I know.I'am going to clean them later.'(=I've decided to clean them but I haven't arranged to clean them).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was going to (do something)= I intended to do it but didn't do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not use will to talk about what you have already decided or arranged to do.We often use will in those situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offering to do sth.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That bag looks very heavy.I will help with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreeing to dong something.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A:You know that book I lent you.Can I have it back if you've finished with it? B:Of course.I'll give it to you this after noon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promising to do sth.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won't tell anyone what happend.I promise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking somebody to do sth.(Will you ...?)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will you please be quiet?I'm trying to concentrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;不规则动词们:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fall-&amp;gt;fell-&amp;gt;fallen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fly-&amp;gt;flew-&amp;gt;flown&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of traffic accidents is increasingly large recently which leads to a various of social problems.Some people
think that the best and only way to improve traffic  safety is by imposing severe punishments on those who have violated the traffic
laws.Personally, I totally disagree with this view. It can be improved by educating people about the serious results that accidents
may bring to the drivers and their families as well as punishing the violators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informing people of the consequences of an accident seems to be a better approach  to reduce the accidents on the road.
For instance,we can teach both the drivers and pedestrians about what an accident would bring to their family members,they will
lose their breadwinners and will face financial problems.This means that their families will encounter disability or even
death if they do not follow the laws.Keeping this in mind,they will think twice before  breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand,deterrent from punishing still remains to be a significant way to gain road safety. For example, if an offender
is punished strictly, he and his friends will be deterred and are less possible to offend again.In some countries,if a person
seriously break a certain law,such as drunk driving,he may lose the right to drive again. So, severe punishment surely contributes to
the improvement of road safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion,we can help people to improve the traffic safety by teaching them the importance of safe driving.Although punishment
is also a good way to do so,but it is not the best way and only way.Pedestrians and drivers should all  obey traffic regulations and
laws to keep safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ielts"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry><entry><title>Use Animals For Humans</title><link href="http://synckey.name/posts/2014/12/22/use-animals-for-humans.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-22T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2014-12-22T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Andy</name></author><id>tag:synckey.name,2014-12-22:/posts/2014/12/22/use-animals-for-humans.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is undoubtedly the case that the number of animals used for human being's benefit  is increasingly large.Some people think
this is unethical and unfair to benefit from animals ,but others hold the opposite view. Personally, my opinion is that we should
use animals correctly and ethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly,we are at the top of the food chain, it is completely  natural to kill animals for food.There are thousands of animal farms all over the world which provide chicken,beef and so on,
Without them,many people will encounter starving,because meat is main food that provide protein and nutrition for human beings.In order to live on, we have to raise and kill animals for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile,animals play a significant role in scientific research.They have been used in many fields,ranging from medical tests to space exploring.For instance,
in medical industry, before a new drug is put into production,animal testing is a necessary to see if the drug is safe or have some unpredictable side effects.
We have to depend on animals in those areas,because we do not have alternatives,scientists can not do experiments on a human being instead of a rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, other people argue that we do not have the right to take the animals' lives for our own benefits,lives should be
respected. What is more ,the benefits of researches can not justify the suffering caused. But,this is unrealistic .
We should focus on how to minimize the sufferings that animals experienced when used by people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum,animal is an extremely important source of food for human beings which can contribute to the science as well.We can surely use
animals to live on,but we should use them scientifically and ethically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is undoubtedly that men and women are playing different roles in our society. There are opinions that suggest companies
to employ the same number of females and males. Personally,I don't think this is a good suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally,women have their advantages in many areas.They are tender and have better communication skills so that they
have the ability to make people feel comfortable. This means they are suitable for  many positions,for instance,
consultants,teachers,nursers,in which they can easily reach higher achievements than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However,males are usually physically stronger and more sensible than females.Industries that are labor-intensive may surely
employ  more men than women. Meanwhile, men are better at emotion control which helps them to improve their leadership and
make calm decisions.That is why we can see that there are more male presidents than females, despite the fact that women are
play increasingly significant roles in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So,it is obvious that man and woman both have their own advantages in different professions.Asking the employers to employ the same
number of females and males is unfair and unrealistic.But a company can surely benifit from a balanced number of males and females,
as it can help to promote the productivity.If the productivity of  a company is not bounded to the gender,employing equal
number of men and women seems to be the best choice for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, making the most of the gender advantages is benificial for both companies and society.That is why I don't
agree with the view that forcing the employers to hire the same number of men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distance learning is a relatively recent phenomenon and if it is as  good as traditional classroom-based learning still
remains to be controversial.Many people believe that the online courses are better than those provided at school,but
others hold the totally opposite view.Personally,I think that we can benefit from both approaches,they can make up for
each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of distance learning,it is convenient for adults,especially people who are busy with their works.Studying at
home enables them to receive further education, which is significantly important for us in a tech-driven society.Meanwhile,
the courses on the Internet or TV are usually well prepared and given by renowned experts,which helps to ensure the quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But school education is surely one of the most import sources of information and knowledge.They can provide structured courses
as well as better schedules.The teachers in the school can not only help us to learn,but also provide specific guidances
and life experience.And discussing with classmates from the school contributes to better understanding of what we are
learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So,we can make the most of both distance learning and classroom-based learning. If a student did not catch waht he had learned
on the class,he can download some courses from Internet to make up for it.An adult can also turn to classes for help
when he encounter some problems which he can not tackle all by himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while we are taking advantage of technology,we should not neglect the importance of traditional learning.We should
chose our learning methods according to our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ielts"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry><entry><title>What Should Be the Main Function Of A University</title><link href="http://synckey.name/posts/2014/11/12/what-shuld-be-the-main-function-of-a-university.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-12T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2014-11-12T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Andy</name></author><id>tag:synckey.name,2014-11-12:/posts/2014/11/12/what-shuld-be-the-main-function-of-a-university.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. 
Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake,
regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, in your …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. 
Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake,
regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
Write at least 250 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; this is my practice writing  which may be the worst approach.I am glad to receive any kind of advises(grammar or misuse,etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently,what kind of knowledge should a university provide its graduates with has been increasingly popular.Some of us
hold the view that universities should teach their students job-related skills.But others do not agree,they
think that universities should mainly focus on theoretical knowledge.Personally,I agree with the later view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic knowledge,many of which have developed for hundred of years and have been refined by countless of experts,is 
significantly important to a university student.Without it, they can not form their systematic knowledge of their 
professions which will lead to serious results,for instance,they may be unable to do further or complex jobs.That is why 
many people think that the universities should put more attention on teaching basic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more,companies concern about the ability of solving problems and the ability to learn fast more than job skills.
Many renowned companies,such as google and facebook,ask a lot of basic questions in their job interviews.They believe 
that,if you are able to learn the basic lessons well at school, you can soon become a skilled employee after professional
trainings.So, if a university teaches basic knowledge better,it can anticipate more competitive graduates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the job-related skills, the technology used in industry is developing extraordinarily fast that the universities can 
not keep pace with it.It is hard for them to decide what is the best skill for their students.However,they should not totally
ignore the requirements of the job market,alternatively,they can invite some companies to their campus to introduce what 
kind of skill they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary,although the main goal of going to universities of many students is finding a ideal job after graduating,universities
should help their students to build a good knowledge system and help them to be quick learners and problem solvers instead of
just teaching them job-related skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ielts"></category><category term="writing"></category></entry></feed>
